netlify deploy --prod
```

### Option 3: Drag & Drop (Simplest)

1. **Create a ZIP file** of your project (exclude node_modules)
2. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
3. **Drag and drop** the ZIP file to the deploy area

}
```

## Updating Your Site

### Via GitHub (Continuous Deployment)
1. Make changes to your code
2. Commit and push to GitHub
3. Netlify automatically rebuilds and deploys

### Via Netlify CLI
```bash
netlify deploy --prod
```

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Replace quotes.json** with your full 5,000 quotes dataset
2. **Test all endpoints** to ensure they work correctly
3. **Share your API** with users
4. **Monitor usage** via Netlify analytics

## Troubleshooting

### Function Not Working?
- Check Netlify Functions logs in dashboard
- Ensure `netlify.toml` is in root directory
- Verify `quotes.json` is valid JSON

### Site Not Loading?
- Check build logs in Netlify dashboard
- Ensure `index.html` is in root directory

### CORS Issues?
- Headers are already configured in the function
- Check browser console for specific errors
